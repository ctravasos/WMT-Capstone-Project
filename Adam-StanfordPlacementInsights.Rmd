summary(impressions_model)

#CTR (-4.49, p < 0.001): A negative relationship with Impressions, suggesting that a higher CTR leads to fewer impressions, possibly due to optimization in ad delivery. The CTR's negative effect suggests that when users engage more (higher CTR), the system may optimize by reducing impressions or reallocating budget elsewhere.

#Link.Clicks (62.14, p < 0.001): A strong positive effect, meaning more link clicks result in more impressions.

#DevicePlatform (mobile_app: 96.45, p < 0.001): Ads shown on mobile apps receive significantly more impressions.
