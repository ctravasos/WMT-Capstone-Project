#General R Tips
```{r}
#Tip 1: Ensure all the packages needed such as dplyr are installed first. Utilize the code: install.packages('package_name') in the console

#Tip 2: Load in the necessary libraries such as dplyr needed before performing data analysis. Utilize the code: library(package_name)

#Tip 3: If using an r markdown file (file_name.rmd) rather than an r script (file_name.r), use on a windows the shortcut ('Ctrl + alt + i') to create a chunk. For the code to run in an r markdown file, it must be in a chunk

#Tip 4: Use the pound/hashtag symbol ('#") to write notes within the code. The text after the pound symbol will not be considered code, therefore will not run. Also, one can tell the text is coded out because the information will be italicized and a different font color

#Tip 5: The r markdown file can be converted into a pdf or html through the 'Knit' element. Simply click 'Knit' (Near the top of the screen) and then either 'Knit to Html' or 'Knit to PDF'

#Tip 6: R is case sensitive
```

#Step 1: Load the necessary libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr) #dplyr is a data manipulation package
library(data.table) #data.table can be used to create enhanced dataframes and data manipulation
library(ggplot2) #ggplot2 is a data visualization package
library(xgboost) #xgboost is a machine learning package for gradient boosting
library(randomForest) #randomForest is a machine learning package for the random forest algorithm
library(lubridate) #lubridate is used to work with date and times
library(readr) #readr is used to load in delimited files such as .csv files
library(tidyverse) #tidyverse is a data manipulation and exploration package
library(tidyr) #tidyr is a package for tidying data (Ex: Transformations, missing values)
library(caret) #caret is a machine learning package
library(shiny) #Shiny is a web application package
library(DT) #Provides an interface to the JavaScript library DataTables
library(plotly) #plotly is an interactive data visualization package
library(stringr) #Package for pattern detection within strings
```

#Step 2: Load in all the Datasets
```{r}
#Note: The file path directory could/will be different for everyone depending on where the file is stored

#Tip: Locate the file within File Explorer. Copy and past the file path/directory (At the top of file explorer) into the code. Please note that the backslashes ('\') will have to be changed to slashes ('/'). See the example code below
